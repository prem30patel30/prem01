1.Overview

This is a Python program that implements a simple library system. It allows users to add books, checkout books, return books, display books, and exit the system.

2.Attributes:

book_id_counter: an integer that keeps track of the next book ID to be assigned (initialized to 1)
books: a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a book with its ID, title, author, and status (available or checked out)

3.Methods:

__init__: the constructor method that initializes the book_id_counter and books attributes
add_book: adds a new book to the system with a unique ID, title, author, and status (available)
checkout_book: checks out a book by updating its status to "checked out" if it's available
return_book: returns a book by updating its status to "available" if it's checked out
display_books: displays all books in the system with their IDs, titles, authors, and statuses
main Function

The main function is the entry point of the program. It creates an instance of the LibrarySystem class and provides a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the system.

4.Menu Options:

Add Book: prompts the user to enter a book title and author, and then adds the book to the system
Checkout Book: prompts the user to enter a book ID, and then checks out the book if it's available
Return Book: prompts the user to enter a book ID, and then returns the book if it's checked out
Display Books: displays all books in the system
Exit: exits the program
